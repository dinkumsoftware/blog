For a long while, svn has been "broken"

See initial-svn-crash-message.txt

A    tc/sailing/sd-backups/user-data/System.fsh
svn: Reading one svndiff window read beyond the end of the representation

To identify which version was broken I wrote: svn-test

Checks out to revision "tc-rev" to "tc"
If successfully, mvs {tc-rev,tc} to {prior-rev,prior-tc}
bumps tc-rev, and trys again.
    When failed:
        tc-rev          1058
        tc-prior-rev    1057

To find the failing file:
    svn checkout -r 1057 svn+ssh://ernie.dinkumsoftware.com/home/dinkum/opt/svn/trunk/tc/sailing/sd-backups/ narrow-it-down-1057 | tee narrow-it-down-1057.txt
    svn checkout -r 1058 svn+ssh://ernie.dinkumsoftware.com/home/dinkum/opt/svn/trunk/tc/sailing/sd-backups/ narrow-it-down-1058 | tee narrow-it-down-1058.txt

and then diff the *.txt files

The bad file:
A    narrow-it-down-1057/navionics-Boston-NewYork-MD-slash-674P+US1GUU1SML1BSS
-rw-rw-r-- 1 tc tc 7948206080 Jan  2 17:05 navionics-Boston-NewYork-MD-slash-674P+US1GUU1SML1BSS

google produced various answers. Basically svn dump before and after the bad version and load them together.

Try svnadmin verify:
ssh ernie:
svnadmin verify home/dinkum/opt/svn/trunk/

Failed at 1058

Try the rest
svnadmin --revision 1059 verify home/dinkum/opt/svn/trunk/

no workee on old fodora.  Doesn't take args.
cannot copy over svnadmin, wrong libraries.

Try to mount ernie locally.
did so at ~/.dvfs/SFTP for tec on ernie.dinkumsoftware.com/home/dinkum/opt/svn

svnadmin verify -r 1059:HEAD .

svn log -r 1058
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r1058 | tc | 2013-08-07 08:38:32 -0400 (Wed, 07 Aug 2013) | 1 line

navionics chart update
------------------------------------------------------------------------
So that's the only thing that changed in version 1058.
That's good.  If no other versions are corrupt, I can:
       ernie:dump 0-1057
       ernie:dump 1059-HEAD
       bert: load them both in new subversion.
no other version corrupt.

Don't have enough disk space.
svn is 41G. I have 6G available.
Mount /media/sdc1 locally, it has enough

cd data/family
ln -s ~/.gvfs/SFTP.../home/dinkum/opt/svn
ln -s ~/.svfs/SFTP...bert/media/sdc1

svnadmin dump svn --revision 0:1057    > svn-recovery/svnadmin-dump-0-to-1057.dump
svnadmin dump svn --revision 1059:HEAD > svn-recovery/svnadmin-dump-1059-to-HEAD.dump

2015-01-03 tc@DinkumSoftware.com 
It hung overnight.  Perhaps because I had two at once.
Do them serially.

svnadmin: Can't write to stream: Operation not supported

Try it on ernie.

0:1057 worked.
1059:HEAD failed.  svnadmin: Reading one svndiff window read beyond the end of the representation

I'm guessing it failed when it hit 1058.  Try it with --incrementatal so it doesn't have to read 1058

svnadmin dump svn --incremental --revision 1059:HEAD > svn-recovery/svnadmin-dump-1059-to-HEAD.dump

WARNING: Referencing data in revision 1058, which is older than the oldest
WARNING: dumped revision (1059).  Loading this dump into an empty repository
Succeeded except for warning.  Ended with:
* Dumped revision 1343.

So try to put it together on bert.
If it fails, maybe created a dummy 1058 with zero length file.
tomorrow.....

2015-01-04 tc@DinkumSoftware.com 

on bert:
cd ~tc
mkdir network-services ; Root dir of things served
svnadmin create network-services/svn

stick with svn+ssh:
   The svn client logs in via ssh and invokes the svnserve daemon on the server.
   Kills svnserve when done
Doesn't look like I need any conf/svnserve.conf configuration.

cd ~/network-services
svnadmin load svn < ~/svn-recovery/svnadmin-dump-0-to-1057.dump

svnadmin load svn < ~/svn-recovery/svnadmin-dump-1059-to-HEAD.dump

This is churning along, but I found some working copies on orphan that were not tucked away into svn.
So:
 x  note the latest revision on ernie (which is in the svn dump of 1059:HEAD)
       HEAD 1343
 x  rename svn dump of 1059:HEAD ==> svn dump of 1059:<whatever>
 x  commit everything on orphan and move it to: ~tc/prior-data
 x  there were two copies of fsc on orphan:
       ~/data/fsc
       ~data/dinkum/customers/fsc    this one has a conflict, but ~/data/fsc is newer
 -   So nothing to commit
 -  on ernie: svn dump --incremental --revision <whatever+1>:HEAD
 -  scp it to bert

Ok, put the 2nd part in:
bert: 
svnadmin load svn < ~/svn-recovery/svnadmin-dump-1059-to-1343.dump

error:
tc@bert:~/network-services$ svnadmin load --quiet svn < ~/svn-recovery/svnadmin-dump-1059-to-1343.dump 
svnadmin: E160013: File not found: revision 1045, path '/trunk/customers/FSC/2013-u11g1/2013-u11g1-rankings.txt'

probably wrong parent directory.
Do a checkout on orphan:
   svn checkout svn+ssh:eth0.bert.dinkumsoftware.com/home/tc/network-services/svn/trunk ~tc/data/svn-root

Don't have enough room. Only 5.4G available.
prior data is 29G. mv it away. Put it on bert.
     scp -rp ~/prior-data eth0.bert.dinkumsoftware.com:prior-data
     ssh eth0.bert.dinkumsoftware.com mv prior-data prior-svn-data-from-orphan-2015-01-04.delete-in-2015-02

svn checkout svn+ssh://eth0.bert.dinkumsoftware.com/home/tc/network-services/svn/trunk ~tc/data/svn-root

Still not enough space... grr

2015-01-05 tc@DinkumSoftware.com 
Do it on luna:  svn checkout svn+ssh://eth0.bert.dinkumsoftware.com/home/tc/network-services/svn/trunk ~tc/data/svn-root
done. 43G

back to bert with --parent-dir arg:
tc@bert:~/network-services$ svnadmin load --parent-dir svn svn < ~/svn-recovery/svnadmin-dump-1059-to-1343.dump 

That didn't help.
but I think I skipped a rev: 1057
ernie:
  568  svnadmin dump svn --revision 0:1057    > svn-recovery/svnadmin-dump-0-to-1057.dump
  572  svnadmin dump svn --incremental --revision 1059:HEAD > svn-recovery/svnadmin-dump-1059-to-HEAD.dump

But when I did:
ernie: 603  svnadmin dump --incremental --revision 1057 svn > svn-recovery/svnadmin-dump-1057.dump 
It didn't have any FSC stuff in it.  Only sailing stuff.

svnlook shows that there is version 1057 in the repo.

I don't get it.
Try svnrdump on bert
Can't ssh from bert to ernie, orphan doesn't have it.  try luna.

svnrdump dump --incremental -r1059:HEAD svn+ssh://eth0.ernie.dinkumsoftware.com/home/dinkum/opt/svn > svnrdump.ernie.1059.HEAD.dump

same results when loading.

Got to be a --parent-dir problem.
or not....

try dumping 1058

svnrdump dump --incremental -r1058 svn+ssh://eth0.ernie.dinkumsoftware.com/home/dinkum/opt/svn > svnrdump.ernie.1059.dump
tc@eth0.ernie.dinkumsoftware.com's password:

bert: svnadmin load svn < svnrdump.ernie.1059.dump
luna: svn update
bert: svnadmin load svn < svndump.ernie.1059.HEAD.dump
seems to be working!

x on luna: svn update
x on bert: svnadmin verify

x    snapshot bert via root-rsync-mirror
x    remove bert: prior-data

Reorganize svn:
    active              ; stuff I check out to clients normally, e.g. orphan into ~/svn-root-active
    yesterdays-news     ; archived stuff, matches directory structure originally under active.

root-rsync-mirror push wouldn't work.
  /etc/sshd_config:
    #PermitRootLogin without-password
    PermitRootLogin	yes
    sudo service sshd restart

<done> change it back and restart

working on yesterdays-news on luna.
in process.  Start with hardware/computers...

2015-01-06 tc@DinkumSoftware.com
