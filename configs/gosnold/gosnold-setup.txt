2019-04-15 tc@DinkumSoftware.com Transcribing paper

** Following is transcribed from paper.  Original paper in
** gosnold file

2019-04-09
Initial boot:  Asked typical startup questions.
Livepatch ? (canonical service to update kernel without rebooting) No
Setup screen hung. Ctrl-Alt-Del logged out tc.  Then it was OK.

connected blue tooth mouse using settings/device connect

updated firmware from ubuntu Software app

Bluetooth Mouse connection didn't survive reboot.
Fixed via google search:
    Bluetooth Mouse won't reconnect after reboot ubuntu 18.04LTS

Updated all Firmware from Ubuntu Software app
Updated all ubuntu software via software updater. ~600mb
    grub modified... I kept the one installed

Adjusted bert /etc/hosts.allow to allow casey backup to bert:
    rcp: 10.23.0.0/24
Removed it afterward

2019-04-09

Swap capslock and ctrl with Gnome Tweaks

To make ssh work, transfer on flash drive casey=>goslnold
    ~tc/.ssh/amazon-key-pair-one.pem config id_rsa idrsa.pub

To make ssh work for a long time without disconnecting:
/etc/ssh/ssh_config: Add
    # Added ServerAliveInterval and ServerAliveCountMax  to prevent "Broken
    # pipe" timeouts. Copied from casey
# These added to prevent long ssh sessions from timing out
    ServerAliveInterval  120
    ServerAliveCountMax 2160
    
rcp -rp casey:~tc bert:network-services/backups/casey-tilde-tc

Adjusted screen blank/lock time via "setup"
Used tweaks to tune window behavior.

Set up Thunderbird
    # DO the copy BEFORE running thunderbird.
    # If it has already run:  rm -rf ~tc/thunderbird
    rcp -rp casey:~tc/.thunderbird gosnold/~tc


Chrome:
    do not sync passwords
    casey:
       Export passwords.  Notes shaky, but may have to do chrome://flags
       and enable export passwords
    gosnold:
      Set up sync (all but passwords)
      chrome://flags  ; enable Password Inport ; relaunch chrome
      go to passwords  ; ...  ; import from file created above

2019-04-11

Added printers
Turn off touch pad (via settings)
Set screen background via Settings and ~/Pictures/ocean.jpg

Got emacs going.
apt install emacs 25
(from git) dinkum/emacs/bin/dinkum-install-tc-emacs

Functions keys don't work.  As shipped Function keys are passed to
Dell hardware usage.  Holding down Fn means passed to application.
Swap that behavior in the bios.
    reboot and pound on F2
    Post Behavior
         FN Lock
         Lock Mode Disable/Standard
         Lock Mode Disable/Secondary   CHECK   ; F<n> passed thru to app
    Apply
    Exit

Made mouse bigger: Settings: Universal Access: Largest

** End of paper transcription


Configured git via repo saved shell script:
dinkum/git/bin/dinkum-git-configure-for-tc

  git config --global user.email  "tc@DinkumSoftware.com"
  git config --global user.name   "tom campbell
  git config --global core.editor emacs"


Recloned git repos with username so doesn't ask for it on a push.
    git clone https://dinkumsoftware@github.com/dinkumsoftware/dinkum.git
    git clone https://dinkumsoftware@github.com/dinkumsoftware/dinkum-working-notes.git

Did final backup of casey:
    casey:dinkumroot-rsync-mirror-push bert ~/tc/network-services/backups/...

Creating a recovery flash drive, using installed dell recovery app.

1st attempt failed writing to usb flash (32G VFAT) that was mounted.
2nd try seemed to work, not sure the difference. Wrong 2nd try fails.

Sigh... Dell writes shit software
Dell Recover App make a *.iso [~tc/Downloads/ubuntu-18.04-amd64-dell_X00.iso ]
Used Startup Disk Disk Creator to write it.
Left *.iso file.  Wouldn't book on casey.

Probably won't work on gosnold either, but i don't want to test it.

Last try for casey.... virgin ubuntu disk.

NFG
Run app "create startup disk"
Select usb flash disk; select *.iso file

Try from the command line
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-a-bootable-ubuntu-18-04-usb-stick-on-linux/

    insert flash
    lsblk   ; /dev/sda sda1  /media/tc/Lexar
    sudo umount /dev/sda1
    sudo dd bs=4M if=/home/tc/projects/ubuntu/ubuntu-18.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sda status=progress oflag=sync
this failed on casey

I checked gpg signatures on ubuntu-18.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso

Try it a dvd.
    apps search Brasero
    burn the iso

On casey:
  Booted OK, but didn't have mouse.
  Burn and try the gosnold recovery disk.
  
Burned gosnold recovery disk
    ubuntu-18.04-amd64-dell_X00.iso
On casey:
   legacy: failed
   UEFI: booted and then got black screen.
So long casey.

Fixing up .bashrc and the like.

.bashrc:
# Search the current directory
# but do it last so system stuff takes precendence.
export PATH="$PATH:."

# Best editor in the world
export EDITOR="$(which emacs)"
.profile
# NOTE: These must be here (instead of .bashrc) if they
#       need to be read by an icon launched gnome application
# For use by emacs date-and-sign()
export DINKUM_USER_EMAIL="tc@DinkumSoftware.com"

Get the encrypted file system to mount.
sudo apt install encfs
Fixed bug in mount-crypt where it complained about directories.

Get toolbar on 2nd display.
Settings/Dock/Show on "all displays"

# Get my google drive mounted.
# There is built in access in 18.04 which is where I'll start
# Multiple choices:
    https://linoxide.com/tools/how-use-google-drive-ubuntu-linux/


Settings/Online Accounts/Google just sort of worked.
I have 0 files there and about 15 Gb available for free.
200 Gbytes is a couple of bucks/month.

Some of the choices do a real file system mount of amazon.
Might want to look at that in the future.

Get some configuration control over etc
sudo apt install etckeeper  # looks like it just worked.
Did it on bert as well.

Create /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/global-dinkumsoftware-search-domain.conf

# /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/global-dinkumsoftware-search-domain.conf
# append dinkumsoftware.com to all dns lookups.
# i.e. allow "ssh gosnold" ==> ssh gosnold.dinkumsoftware.com"

[global-dns]
searches=dinkumsoftware.com

That worked.

Except now I can't find the file
and it only works for ethernet

I Put the file back, but it only works for ethernet, not wifi.
It appears their is an /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/dinkumsoftware
    [IP4]
    dns-search=

That overwrites the /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/ [global dns] searches=
line.
Examine /etc/resolv.conf to tell.

Someone suggested if you modify /etc/network/interfaces to put
dns-search in the loop back field... it would work.  It didn't.

OK... found:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1068467/how-to-set-domain-search-on-ubuntu-18-04

; Run this to edit /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/dinkumsoftware and restart wifi
sudo nmcli c show
sudo nmcli c modify dinkumsoftware ipv4.dns-search dinkumsoftware.com
sudo nmcli c down dinkumsoftware && nmcli c up dinkumsoftware

The ethernet seems to just work.  Not sure why, I took out the
/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/global-dns-... file

The blue tooth mouse doesn't survive power on and/or suspend.  It used to.
There were multiple threads on the net about it.

It appear to connect/disconnect every couple of seconds.
I went in with sudo bluetoothctl and paired (had to hit button on mouse)
and connected.  It was already trusted.

Similar problems discussed on switch to 18.04
multiple suggestions.

https://medium.com/@overcode/fixing-bluetooth-in-ubuntu-pop-os-18-04-d4b8dbf7ddd6

dpkg --status bluez | grep '^Version:'
Version: 5.48-0ubuntu3.1

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bluetooth/bluez
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt upgrade

The following packages will be upgraded:
  bluez bluez-cups bluez-obexd console-setup console-setup-linux distro-info-data im-config keyboard-configuration libbluetooth3 libnss-myhostname libnss-systemd

dpkg --status bluez | grep '^Version:'

That made it survive power on.
That made it survive suspend.
    systemctl suspend
When tried systemctl hibernate
    system got wierd and when came back, mouse wouldn't connect.
sigh.
power down/up. Still wouldn't connect.  Getting error messages in /var/log/syslog.

Messed around deleting the mouse device and then scan/pair/trust/
connect with bluetoothctl and that made it work.  It survived one power off/on.
I'm under no illusions that it's fixed.  Need to carry wired mouse when
traveling as the pad is shut off.

Chasing crash at boot up.
Coming from

/var/crash/_usr_lib_gnome-session_gnome-session-check-accelerated.120.crash
Dated Apr 11 15:48
I think is a single crash (a SEGFAULT in gnome-session-check-accelerated)
which gets reported over and over as one reboots.

mv'ed the crash file to /root/btrsh
